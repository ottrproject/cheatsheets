# Tips for AI use

- Don't use prmopts that would violate data privacy restrictions or licensing (most comercial tools are not private!)
- Be specific and iterate on prompts
- Where possible work in an environment that allows for projects to retain the context
- Typically asking AI to improve existing work is better than starting from scratch
- Check everything! Ask the AI to question itself and have a human (maybe you) review text and code

The more substance and original thought you provide the more substance and original thought your final product will have!

# Challenges and Mitigation


<div class = myStyle>
|Challenge|Possible Mitigation Methods| Resources/Tools|
|----|-----|-----|
|Giving credit for other people's work used to train models is difficult | Be transparent about how you use AI tools, include tool versions. Ask the tool for sources to credit. Choose tools that are more transparent about what data was used for training | Good example...|
|Data privacy is tricky - Some tools are using data that should not have been available| - Choose tools that are more transparent about what data was used for training. <br> - Look into those data sources and see if they followed data privacy regulations. <br>- Never use private data or info in a prompt for a commercial tool| See if your institute offers private tools|


|Environmental Impact - AI tools use data centers that require lots of electricity and water for cooling| - Consider if AI is really needed for a task <br> - Choose tools that are transparent about energy use and attempts to improve efficiency <br> - Choose models that use a smaller number of parameters, designed with methods like [parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)](https://huggingface.co/blog/peft) https://codewave.com/insights/parameter-efficient-fine-tuning-peft-methods/, or simply designed for more specific tasks and therefore often requiring less memory usage <br> [Consider using a model locally on your computer](https://www.ainewshub.org/post/top-9-open-source-ai-models-you-can-run-on-your-own-pc-right-now-2025-edition-updated)  
<br>- Consider tools that have data centers in cooler climate locations or use the heat the generate for other uses
| -GreenPT is a very cool example of a considerate tool - Ollama, Gemma 2, Mistral AI, Phi-4|
|Trust and Unskilling| Using AI too much can degrade trust in yourself & potentially result in unskilling| Use AI for more specific help, like polishing as opposed to writing things from scratch|afdasd|
|Bias - even simple requests can generate biased response| Be aware of bias, Ask your tools to consdier bias and challeng tools when they fail to recognize bias| afds|

1) Giving credit for people's work is hard & Data privacy is tricky--> Be transparent and specific about AI use, choose models that are transparent about how they were trained. Shop around!
2) 
3) Environmental impact should be considered --> Choose AI tools that are transparent about resource usage and attempts to improve efficiency, consider when AI might not be needed.
https://www.ecolytics.io/blog/ecolytics-launches-offset-ai-the-first-tool-to-track-and-offset-the-environmental-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-usage

4) Using AI too much might degrade your trust in yourself
5) Bias - even simple AI requests can generate biased responses


Environmental Impact is very real: 
Loss of trust in yourself: Use in moderation, read the literature, talk to trainees. You are still a spectacular supercomputer!
Bias: consider responses with this lens - ask chatbots to consider bias and challenge them when they fail.
