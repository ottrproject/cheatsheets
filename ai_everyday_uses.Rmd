# Tips for AI use

-  Make sure the AI tool is secure, or don't use prmopts that would violate data privacy restrictions or licensing
- Be specific and iterate on prompts
- Where possible work in an environment that allows for projects to retain the context
- Typically asking AI to improve existing work is better than starting from scratch
- Check everything! Build in check points, ask the AI to question itself and hace a human (maybe you) review text and code

The more substance and original thought you provide the more substance and original thought your final product will have!

# Challenges and Mitigation

1) Giving credit for people's work is hard & Data privacy is tricky--> Be transparent and specific about AI use, choose models that are transparent about how they were trained. Shop around!
2) 
3) Environmental impact should be considered --> Choose AI tools that are transparent about resource usage and attempts to improve efficiency, consider when AI might not be needed.
4) Using AI too much might degrade your trust in yourself
5) Bias - even simple AI requests can generate biased responses


Environmental Impact is very real: 
Loss of trust in yourself: Use in moderation, read the literature, talk to trainees. You are still a spectacular supercomputer!
Bias: consider responses with this lens - ask chatbots to consider bias and challenge them when they fail.
