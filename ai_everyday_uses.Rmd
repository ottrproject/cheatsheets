# Tips for AI use

- Don't use prompts that would violate data privacy restrictions or licensing (most commercial tools are not private!)
- Be specific and iterate on prompts
- Where possible work in an environment that allows for projects to retain the context
- Typically asking AI to improve existing work is better than starting from scratch
- Check everything! Ask the AI to question itself and have a human (maybe you) review text and code

The more substance and original thought you provide the more substance and original thought your final product will have!

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="60%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "example of more precise ai prompt - can you improve the paragraph is vague, can you make the paragraph more concise is better, can you make the paragraph more concise and appropriate for a highschool student is even better"}

# Challenges and Mitigation Methods


<div class = myStyle>
|Challenge|Possible Mitigation Methods| Resources/Tools|
|----|-----|-----|
|**Giving credit**  <br> Other people's work was used to train models sometimes without permission. | ● Choose tools that are more transparent about what data was used for training <br> ● Be transparent about how you use AI tools, include tool versions <br> ● Ask the tool for sources to credit and check what it gives  you <br>  | Good example...|
|**Data Privacy** <br> Some tools are using data that should not have been available| ● Choose tools that are more transparent about [what data was used for training](https://www.transparencycoalition.ai/news/major-ai-transparency-breakthrough-ai2-model-displays-training-data-sources-linked-to-output). <br> ● Look into those data sources and see if they followed data privacy regulations. <br> ● Never use private data or info in a prompt for a commercial tool| ● See if your institute offers private tools <br> ● Models run locally may be more private |
|**Environmental Impact** <br> AI tools use data centers that require lots of electricity and water for cooling| ● Consider if AI is really needed for a task <br> ● Choose tools that are transparent about energy use and attempts to improve efficiency <br> ● Choose models that use a smaller number of parameters, designed with methods like [parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)](https://huggingface.co/blog/peft), or simply designed for more specific tasks and therefore often requiring less memory usage <br> ● [Consider using a model locally on your computer](https://www.ainewshub.org/post/top-9-open-source-ai-models-you-can-run-on-your-own-pc-right-now-2025-edition-updated)  <br> ● Consider tools that have data centers in cooler climate locations or use the heat the generated for other uses| ● [GreenPT](https://greenpt.ai/) is a very cool example of a considerate tool <br> ● [Ollama](https://mehmetozkaya.medium.com/installing-and-running-llama-and-gemma-models-using-ollama-4c7027ec948c) can help you run models like Gemma 2, Mistral AI, Phi-4 locally <br> ● [Offset AI](https://www.ecolytics.io/blog/ecolytics-launches-offset-ai-the-first-tool-to-track-and-offset-the-environmental-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-usage) is a cool tool that helps you track and offset the environmental impact of your AI usage|
|**Trust and Unskilling**| ● Using AI too much can degrade trust in yourself and potentially result in unskilling <br> ● Humans tend to overtrust AI or technology in some circumstances| ● Use AI for more specific help, like polishing as opposed to writing things from scratch  - <br> ● Use AI only when it will is likely to save you time or tedium  <br> ● Check in with trainees about their use|afdasd|
|**Bias** <br> Even simple requests can generate biased response| ● Be aware that AI tools are biased, Consider responses with this awareness <br> ● Ask tools to consider bias in your prompts <br> ● Challenge tools when they fail to recognize bias <br> ● Recognize that some tasks may be inappropriate for AI because of the potential for bias| afds|
