# What is CI/CD?

CI/CD = Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

The idea is to **test your code as you develop it**.

In other words, if you make a change to your code, you can run your code to see if how it works with **different conditions and environments**.

This can simulate different software users <img src="https://www.iconpacks.net/icons/1/free-icon-user-group-296.png" width = 8%>  or data analysis contexts <img src="https://www.iconpacks.net/icons/4/free-icon-laptop-settings-12589.png" width = 8%>.

# Benefits of CI/CD

- Catch software bugs earlier
- Catch data analysis code bugs too!
- Enhance public trust in your code/software
- Determine if your software updates will work for users on different machines
- Determine if your data analysis code still has the expected outcomes with different permutations

# Implementing CI/CD

- CI/CD typically uses other infrastructure, such as version control and containers or virtual machines
  - Version control is the process of tracking changes over time
  - There are [several tools](https://icubetechnolabs.com/github-vs-gitlab-vs-bitbucket-which-version-control-system-is-right-for-you/) for version control ([GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/version-control-software)), but [GitHub](https://github.com/) is one of the most commonly used by researchers
  - Containers or virtual machines enable us to run code in different [computing environments](https://hutchdatascience.org/Containers_for_Scientists/02-why-containers.html) (which is the specific software for a given computer). 
  - Check out our [ITN course about containers](https://hutchdatascience.org/ITN_course_search/Containers_for_Scientists_coursePage.html)!
- Lab members need to know what working standards are required
  - Onboarding documents like these can help: 
    - [Fertig Lab](https://fertiglab.github.io/onboarding/)
    - [Collado-Torres Lab](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/onboarding.html)
- This [novel about CI/CD](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-phoenix-project/) called _The Phoenix Project_ might be helpful. Check out this [excerpt](https://itrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TPP5_excerpt.pdf)!
