Conferences can feel intimidating, especially your first few.

<br>
But don't worry, this is a common feeling.
Everyone is on an even playing field to ask questions, attend sessions, and network.
You deserve to attend and no one completely understands every talk.
<br>
<br>
Conferences are for branching out and learning new things!
