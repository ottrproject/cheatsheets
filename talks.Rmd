Research Talks at conferences will often have this structure:

- Background 
  - This should cover the context of the field and any information needed for people to understand your research.
- Significance
  - This section should describe why your work is important, why it is needed, and how it adds to the field.
  
- Methods
  - In this section, researchers describe in brief the basics about what general methods you used. 
  - Specific details should be covered if they are necessary in describing your work.
  - If you are using an unusal or new method that you developed, more detail should be described.
  
- Results
  - This is where you show figures and statistics of your results
  - It is also critical to explain your interpretation of your results, in other words, what might they mean, and what are possible limitations.
