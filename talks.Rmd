## Structure {-}

<div class="row">
<div class="column">

Research talks at conferences will often have this structure:

1. **Background & Significance**
  - This should cover the context of the field and any information needed for people to understand your research.
  - This section should describe why your work is important, why it is needed, and how it contributes to the field.
3.  **Methods**
  - In this section, researchers briefly describe the general methods used.
  - Specific details should be covered if they are necessary for describing your work.
  - If you are using an unusual or new method that you developed, more detail should be provided.
  


</div>


<div class="column">

4. **Results**
  - This is where you show figures and statistics of your results.
  - Itâ€™s essential to explain what your results mean and their possible limitations.

5. **Impact and Future Directions**
  - In this section, researchers describe what they plan to do next and the significance of their findings.

<div class="column">


<input type="checkbox"> Simple is often better

- People can only retain so much information at conferences; make sure the key information is clear.

- Focus on the impact and significance, especially for short talks.

- People can ask for additional details.

<input type="checkbox"> Tailor your talk for your audience

- Even though there may be experts, remember that there are likely attendees who are totally new to your subject area.

<input type="checkbox">  Practice your talk!

<input type="checkbox">  Show up early to test opening your talk and advancing slides.

<input type="checkbox">  Have a backup version of your presentation in another format, in case there are technical difficulties. 

- A PDF version works well!

## Preparation {-}
<div class="row">
<div class="column">

<input type="checkbox">  **Draft the slides**

- <input type="checkbox"> Determine the time limit required. 

- <input type="checkbox">  Draft slides according to the time limit. 
  - **Focus on visuals over text** 
  - **Keep slides simple!**

- <input type="checkbox">  Include a thank you slide, with grant numbers that funded the work.

<input type="checkbox">  **Check your slides**

- <input type="checkbox">  Check your own slides for  language clarity.

- <input type="checkbox">  Check that fonts and figures are large enough .
(Size 18 or larger is often recommended.)

- <input type="checkbox">  Check that figures aren't blurry. 
(You might need to use a higher quality or larger image.)

- <input type="checkbox">  Check that all jargon is explained .
(Jargon that is expected by your audience doesn't need to be defined, such as RNA.)

- <input type="checkbox">  Check that all acronyms are spelled out the first time.

- <input type="checkbox"> Check that images cite sources if not original.

<input type="checkbox">  **Practice your talk**

- <input type="checkbox"> Practice giving your talk and adjust to fit the time limit. 
(Even if just practicing by yourself!)

- <input type="checkbox">  Get feedback from others where possible (including your PI and labmates). Be prepared to iterate and change your talk several times.

</div>

<div class="column">



<input type="checkbox"> **Share info!**

 - <input type="checkbox">  Include your contact information, so others can reach out.


- <input type="checkbox"> Consider adding your talk to your professional website.

- _Optional_: Include a link or QR code so others can find your talk easily! 
(Only do this if it is OK with your PI. Tools like [Bitly](https://app.bitly.com/) can help!)

 Ways to Really Improve:
 
 - **Watch talks!** Pay attention to good speakers and emulate them.

## Answering Questions {-}

<div class="column">

1) **Prepare for questions**

You can come up with a list of questions you think people might ask and prepare answers for those questions.

With more experience it will be clear what kinds of questions are typically asked.

2) **It is OK to say you don't know** 

You can speculate, but be clear that you are speculating.


3) **People may ask too many questions**

You can tell people that you would like to discuss more with them later.

4) **People may not have questions**

Just because people don't ask you questions, doesn't mean they weren't engaged. Stick around after the talk to see if anyone approaches you. Even if they don't, talks at the end of sessions or before lunch, sometimes don't get the same level of attention.
