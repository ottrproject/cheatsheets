## Structure {-}

<div class="row">
<div class="column">

Research talks at conferences will often have this structure:

1. **Background** 
  - This should cover the context of the field and any information needed for people to understand your research.
2. **Significance**
  - This section should describe why your work is important, why it is needed, and how it adds to the field.
3.  **Methods**
  - In this section, researchers describe in brief the basics about what general methods you used. 
  - Specific details should be covered if they are necessary in describing your work.
  - If you are using an unusual or a new method that you developed, more detail should be described.
  


</div>


<div class="column">

4. **Results**
  - This is where you show figures and statistics of your results
  - It is also critical to explain your interpretation of your results, in other words, what might they mean, and what are possible limitations. 

5. **Impact and Future Directions**
  - In this section, researchers describe what they plan to do next and the importance of their results

<div class="column">



<input type="checkbox"> Focus on the impact and significance, especially for short talks. 

- People can ask for additional details

<input type="checkbox"> Simple is often better.

- People can only retain so much information at conferences, make sure the key information is clear.

<input type="checkbox"> Focus on your audience

- Even though there may be experts, remember that there are likely attendees who are totally new to your subject area. Tailor your talk to who will likely attend. 


<input type="checkbox">  Practice your talk!

<input type="checkbox"> Use large font, typically size 18 or larger

- Avoid images with small font as well

<input type="checkbox">  Show up early to test opening your talk and advancing slides

<input type="checkbox">  Have a backup version of your presentation in another format, in case there are technical difficulties 

- A PDF version works well!

1. <input type="checkbox"> Check that images cite sources if not original

<input type="checkbox">  **Practice your talk**

1. <input type="checkbox"> Practice giving your talk and adjust to fit the time limit (even if just to yourself!)

1. <input type="checkbox">  Get feedback from others where possible (including your PI and lab mates). Be prepared to iterate and change your talk several times.

</div>

<div class="column">



<input type="checkbox"> **Share info!**





1. <input type="checkbox">  Include your contact information, so others can reach out

1. <input type="checkbox">  _Optional_: Include a link or QR code so others can find your talk easily!

## Answering Questions {-}

<div class="row">
<div class="column">

<img src="css/images/question.png" width = 40%>

</div>
<div class="column">

1) **Prepare for questions**

You can come up with a list of questions you think people might ask and prepare answers for those questions.

With more experience it will be clear what kinds of questions are typically asked.

2) **It is ok to say you don't know** 

You can speculate, but be clear that you are speculating.


3) **People may ask too many questions**

You can tell people that you would like to discuss more with them later.

4) **People may not have questions**

Just because people don't ask you questions, doesn't mean they weren't engaged. Stick around after the talk to see if anyone approaches you. Even if they don't, talks at the end of sessions or before lunch, sometimes don't get the same level of attention.
